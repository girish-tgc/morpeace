KRUSHNAVAD —

I am Krushnavad —
the tree of folded palms.

Some call me the Krishna Fig,
others smile and call me makhan-katori —
the butter bowl.
Look closely at my leaves:
each one curls gently into a cup,
as if shaped by small divine hands.

I am still young here at Morpeace —
a fresh sapling,
my roots only beginning to explore this soil.
But even in youth,
I carry an old story.

The elders say I remember
the childhood of Krishna himself.
When he stole butter from his mother’s home,
he needed a secret place to hide it.
So I offered my leaves as bowls —
tiny green vessels of mischief and love.

Every new leaf I grow
is folded in that same offering.

Rain gathers in my cups,
and birds lean down to sip.
Insects drink there too,
and sometimes a wandering ant
finds a shining pool in a single leaf.
Even as a sapling,
I am already learning to host life.

Children notice me quickly.
They kneel to examine my small leaves,
touching them with careful fingers.
In their curiosity,
I feel myself welcomed into the forest.

I will grow slowly.
My trunk will thicken.
My crown will widen.
Years from now,
I will cast shade where today there is sun.
But growth is not a race.
It is a promise unfolding.

My teaching is gentle:

“Every great tree begins
as a small act of faith.”

Someone planted me here
believing in a future they may not fully see.
That belief is my nourishment
as much as water and light.

Sit beside me if you wish.
Watch how each leaf holds its tiny bowl
without effort.
This is how hope should be —
quiet, steady, and open.

Here at Morpeace,
I begin my life among older companions,
offering small cups of green
and a reminder that beginnings
are sacred too.

One day I will be tall enough
to shade stories of my own.
For now, I grow —
and that is miracle enough.
