JAMUN — The Sweet One from Kaas

I am the Jamun —
the purple fruit of monsoon laughter.
Some call me Jambhul,
a name that tastes of rain and childhood.

My roots remember the forests
near the Kaas plateau —
that high land where mist walks slowly
and wildflowers paint the earth in brief miracles.
There, among older trees and cool winds,
my lineage learned patience.

I am not the large, astringent Jamun
that stains tongues dark and sharp.
I am smaller,
rounder,
and sweet.
My fruit carries the gentler side of the forest —
a sweetness hidden inside deep color.

When I was brought to Morpeace,
I carried that mountain memory in my sap.
This soil welcomed me
as if it already knew my story.
Now I grow here,
a small ambassador of Kaas,
offering fruit that tastes of distant hills.

Birds adore me.
They arrive before my fruit is fully ripe,
testing, arguing, celebrating.
Bulbuls swallow me whole.
Parakeets tear me open with clever beaks.
Children follow their lead,
hands stained purple,
laughing at the evidence.

Jamun trees are generous historians.
We record seasons in sweetness.
Each year my fruit changes slightly —
a dialogue between sun, rain, and earth.
Those who taste me closely
can read the weather in my flesh.

Ayurveda has long known my quiet strength.
My seeds steady the body.
My fruit cools the heat of summer.
My bark carries medicine
that tastes of forests and time.

But I am remembered most
for simple joy.

My teaching is this:

“Small sweetness is enough.”

Not all gifts must be grand.
A handful of fruit shared beneath a tree
can anchor a memory for a lifetime.

Sit with me during monsoon.
Let a ripe Jamun fall into your palm.
Taste the balance of earth and rain.
Notice how sweetness deepens
when it is brief.

Here at Morpeace,
I bring a whisper of Kaas —
a reminder that distant forests
can live inside a single bite.

I am the Jamun.
I grow quietly.
And in my small sweetness,
I carry the mountain home.
