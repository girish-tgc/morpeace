PEEPAL — Audio Version (Personalised Morpeace Edition)

I am the Peepal — the tree of breath and blessings.
Some call me Pippala,
others Ashvattha,
and in many homes simply the sacred tree.

My leaves are shaped like hearts,
and when the breeze moves through them,
I do not whisper —
I sing.
The villagers say my leaves are always restless,
as if chanting their own mantra.

I did not arrive here by accident.
A small sapling once took root at Morpeace,
fragile and easily overlooked.
Hands protected me,
water was brought in careful vessels,
and a circle of open earth was left around my young trunk
so I could breathe and grow.

Seasons passed,
and I stretched upward into the sky,
finding my place among the older trees.
Now my shade marks a quiet corner of this land —
a space that remembers footsteps and stillness.

Every Thursday,
Kaka comes and sits beneath me.
He brings no ceremony,
only presence.
His breathing slows,
and in that shared silence
my leaves and his thoughts settle together.
Meditation is not taught here —
it simply happens.

People have always sat beneath my kind for clarity.
Sanyasis rested at our trunks,
and householders tied threads for wishes.
I have heard prayers for children,
for marriages,
for healing,
and sometimes simply for peace.

In old stories,
even the wise looked upward toward my crown.
It is said the Bodhi,
under which the Buddha awakened,
was my cousin —
another Peepal from the ancient banks of the Neranjana.
We are old teachers in leaf and root.

Children love me for a different reason —
my shade is cool even in the burning months.
Take one step out of the sun,
and you will feel the difference on your skin.
This is my small kindness to travellers.

Birds visit me throughout the day —
the koel with her silver notes,
the laughing barbet,
and flocks of parakeets hopping across my branches.
Fruit bats come at night,
carrying my seeds to distant soil.
In this way, I travel without moving.

Ayurveda used my tender leaves and bark
to cool the stomach and calm bleeding.
In village remedies,
my latex was mixed with honey
for small wounds and mouth ulcers.
Trees give without invoice.

People sometimes speak of my breath.
They say I release more oxygen at night,
and so elders asked pregnant women
to rest near me in summer.
Science debates the details,
but faith has already chosen —
to many families,
I am the tree that helps you breathe easier.

My teaching is gentle:

“Peace is not the absence of movement.
It is the rhythm beneath it.”

Look at my leaves —
they flutter and tremble,
yet the branch that holds them is steady.
Learn from that.

Sit here if you wish,
as Kaka does each Thursday.
Feel how the body settles
and how the mind softens
when there is nothing to prove.

Here at Morpeace,
I continue my old work —
offering shade, breath,
and a quiet place
where stillness is always welcome.
