KAILASPATI — The Gift That Bloomed

I am the Kailaspati —
the tree that carries a mountain in its flowers.

My blossoms rise directly from my trunk,
as if the earth itself
were offering garlands to the sky.
Look closely and you will understand
why devotees pause before me.

Within each flower
rests a shape that recalls a lingam,
the ancient symbol of Shiva.
Petals curve like a serpent’s hood.
Fragrance gathers in warm air,
turning space into quiet reverence.

But my journey to Morpeace
began not in solitude,
but in friendship.

I arrived here as a gift —
a sapling placed in loving hands
by a friend of Kaka.
There was no ceremony of grandeur,
only the simple generosity
of one heart offering another
a living presence.

Gifts made of wood and leaf
carry a different weight.
They grow.
They remember the moment of giving.
Each root I send into this soil
echoes that gesture of friendship.

Because of my form,
people named me Kailaspati —
the tree of Kailasa,
Shiva’s celestial abode.
Yet I stand here not as distant myth,
but as a reminder
that sacredness often travels
through human bonds.

My blossoms open generously,
drawing bees, butterflies, and wonder.
Children stare at my flowers,
trying to understand
how devotion can take living shape.

My fruits grow round and heavy,
like silent planets resting against my trunk.
They whisper that time itself
is patient and cyclical.

My teaching is gentle:

“A true gift continues to give.”

What is offered with sincerity
does not end at the moment of exchange.
It unfolds season after season,
touching lives unseen.

Sit near me and breathe my fragrance.
Feel how friendship, devotion,
and earth meet quietly in this space.

Here at Morpeace,
I grow as a living memory
of a gift freely given —
a messenger of Kailasa
rooted in human kindness.

I am the Kailaspati.
I bloom from my own body
like gratitude made visible.
And in each flower,
I carry both mountain and friendship home.
