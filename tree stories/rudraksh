RUDRAKSHA — The Tear That Became a Tree

I am the Rudraksha —
a tree born from a tear.

The elders tell that when Shiva opened his eyes
after a long meditation upon the suffering of the world,
a tear fell to the earth.
Where it touched soil,
a Rudraksha tree rose.

That is why my seeds are worn as beads —
small worlds carved by nature,
circling wrists and necks
as reminders of stillness.

Here at Morpeace,
I am still young.
My trunk is slender,
my leaves glossy with newness.
Yet the story in my sap
is ancient.

Rudraksha trees grow slowly.
We do not hurry.
Our work is not spectacle
but presence.
Each bead I will one day bear
will carry the geometry of meditation —
lines and faces etched by time.

Birds already visit my branches,
curious about the quiet I hold.
They sense what sages long ago discovered:
that my shade invites inward turning.

To sit near me
is to feel the world soften at its edges.
Breath lengthens.
Thoughts loosen.
Silence becomes companionable.

I am not planted for fruit alone.
I am planted as a gesture —
a wish that places of dwelling
also become places of awakening.

My teaching is simple:

“Stillness is a form of compassion.”

When the mind grows quiet,
the heart remembers its shape.

One day my beads will ripen
and fall into waiting hands.
They will travel far from this soil,
touching foreheads and fingers,
circling prayers.

But even now, as a sapling,
I begin my work.

Here at Morpeace,
I grow as a small axis of calm —
a living reminder
that forests are not only habitats
but sanctuaries.

Sit near me if you wish.
Close your eyes for a moment.
Listen to the wind moving through leaves.

In that sound,
you may hear the echo
of a tear that chose to become a tree.
