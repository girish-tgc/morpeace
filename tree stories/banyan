BANYAN

I am the Banyan —
the tree that refuses to end.

Across this land, my kind is called immortal.
Not because we never fall,
but because we know how to continue.
Each root I send downward becomes a new trunk,
and each trunk remembers the first.

The elders tell a story older than memory.

When the universe dissolved into endless waters —
during the great Pralaya —
all forms vanished into silence.
And upon a single floating banyan leaf
rested the divine child Krishna,
cradling creation within his breath.

From that image,
my lineage became a symbol of eternal shelter.
If a leaf of mine could carry the divine
through the darkness between worlds,
then surely my shade could carry human hearts
through the storms of life.

Temples rose beside my ancestors.
Pilgrims circled our trunks.
Stories spread from village to village
the way my roots spread through earth —
touching ground, taking hold,
becoming many from one.

But my beginning at Morpeace was quiet.

I slipped into life from the cracks of an old cow shed,
a seed dropped by a passing bird.
Between stone and brick I found a thin seam of soil
and tasted the earth.

The cows breathed warmth above me.
Their slow presence was my first rhythm.
I grew as a green whisper against rough walls,
unnoticed, patient.

When the shed was to be demolished,
hands paused around me.
They saw that I had chosen this land
and that the land had chosen me back.

So I was lifted carefully —
roots wrapped in damp cloth,
earth held like memory —
and carried to the entrance of Morpeace.

There I was planted again,
not as rubble rescued,
but as a tree of honor.

Now I stand as a guardian of thresholds.
Every guest who arrives
passes beneath my young canopy.
Every departure carries a trace of my shade.

Birds have already begun their cities in me.
Parakeets chatter.
Mynas rehearse their gossip.
Squirrels trace quick highways along my limbs.
Even in youth, I am becoming a small universe.

In my spreading form, sages once saw
a mirror of time itself —
life branching, returning, renewing.
And in the child resting upon my leaf,
they saw a deeper truth:

that infinity can rest gently
in the smallest cradle.

My teaching is simple:

“To shelter life is a sacred act.”

To offer space for rest,
for breath,
for wonder —
this is how immortality expresses itself.

Stand with me a moment.
Feel the air cool beneath my leaves.
Imagine the pillars I will one day raise
from roots that descend like blessings.

Here at Morpeace,
I greet all who enter —
a tree once hidden in stone
now standing in open sky,
carrying the memory of cosmic shelter
into a place that is still becoming.

I am the Banyan.
I grow by remembering.
And in that remembrance,
I become timeless.
