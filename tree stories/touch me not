TOUCH-ME-NOT — revised

I am the Touch-Me-Not —
small, quiet, and easily overlooked.

Children know me by my secret:
touch my leaves,
and I fold into myself —
a shy greeting,
a soft boundary.

Long ago, a child planted me beside his ancestral home.
His fingers pressed my tiny roots into warm soil,
not knowing he was planting a memory.
I grew among mango and tamarind,
fig and guava,
watching him run barefoot through a world
that felt endless and green.

Then the machines came.

The great trees fell first —
the tamarind that five people could not encircle,
the pond that once held lilies and sky.
The earth shook,
and silence replaced birdsong.
Most of us disappeared into dust.

But I remained —
a small survivor in the cracks of concrete,
still folding and unfolding with the sun.
No one meant to spare me.
Yet there I was.

When he returned —
the child now grown —
his eyes searched the barren ground
and found me trembling in the ruins.
He knelt and touched my leaves.

I folded gently,
and in that small gesture
I carried a message:

Life remembers how to return.

He did not leave me behind.
Carefully, he lifted me from that broken earth
and carried me to new soil —
to the land that would become Morpeace.

There, I was planted again,
a quiet bridge between past and future.
Around me, a forest began to rise —
saplings placed with intention,
water guided into patient paths,
ten acres breathing back to life.

And I watched with a small, hidden pride.
For this forest — this dream of healing —
began with a whisper I carried.
A tiny leaf folding in the ruins
became the first light beneath these trees.

The dream that grew here was simple:

To let the soil return to its own breath.
To see life unfold in rhythm and grace.
Where roots speak to roots,
and every being finds its place.

And from that dream,
this truth rose quietly from the earth:

Morpeace is not being built —
it is becoming:
leaf by leaf,
breath by breath,
season by season.

I am still small.
I do not tower.
I do not command shade.
But I stand as witness
to a promise kept.

A promise spoken softly into the earth:

To plant with centuries in mind.
To guard the quiet and the unseen.
To listen more than we speak,
and leave this Earth a little richer than we found it.

My teaching is simple:

Sensitivity is not weakness.
It is awareness.
And awareness is the beginning of care.

Touch me, and I fold.
Wait a moment, and I open again.
This is resilience —
not hardness,
but the courage to reopen.

Here at Morpeace,
I live close to the ground,
watching a forest grow from remembered love.
And I whisper to all who kneel to greet me:

Even the smallest life
can awaken a dream —
and from that dream,
a forest can energe.
