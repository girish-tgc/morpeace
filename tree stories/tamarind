TAMARIND — The Tree That Began Morpeace

I am the Tamarind —
the tree that remembers beginnings.

Long before Morpeace had a name,
before land was purchased
or dreams were spoken aloud,
I stood in an courtyard of childhood.

My trunk was wide enough
that five people could not encircle it.
Children measured their courage
by climbing my lower branches.
My pods ripened in the heat of summer,
sour and sweet,
a taste that stitched itself
into memory.

I watched a boy grow beneath me —
barefoot, laughing,
his pockets filled with my fruit
and the careless certainty
that this world would always remain.

Trees know better.

When the time came for walls to rise
and concrete to claim the ground,
I was promised safety.
Words were spoken gently:
the trees will remain.

But machines do not understand promises.

I fell quickly.
My roots were torn from soil
that had held me for decades.
The pond beside me vanished.
The lilies disappeared.
And in my absence
a silence opened
that no building could fill.

When he returned
and saw the emptiness where I once stood,
something shifted inside him.
Grief has a way of planting seeds
that joy alone cannot.

Standing on that barren earth,
he made a vow —
not to replace me,
for no tree can truly replace another —
but to rebuild a forest
where loss would become life.

That vow became Morpeace.

Every sapling planted there
carried a trace of my memory.
Every root pressing into new soil
answered the question my absence left behind:

What if we could grow back what was taken?

I do not stand at Morpeace in my old form.
My original trunk lives now
only in memory and story.
But I am present in another way.

I live in the intention
that shaped that land.
In the care given to every young tree.
In the promise to let forests return
instead of disappear.

My teaching is simple:

“Loss can be a doorway to creation.”

What is cut down
can awaken a deeper planting.
What disappears
can call forth something larger.

Sit beneath any tree at Morpeace
and you sit partly in my shade.
Taste any fruit there
and you taste a continuation
of the vow made in my absence.

Here at Morpeace,
I exist as origin —
the quiet reason a forest stands
where emptiness once did.

I am the Tamarind.
I fell,
and from that falling
a forest was born.
