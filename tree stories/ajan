AJAN —

I am the Ajan —
a tree born from a pilgrim’s staff.

Here at Morpeace I am only a young sapling,
my trunk slender,
my leaves still tasting their first seasons.
But the story that flows through me
began centuries ago in Alandi.

When the young saint Dnyaneshwar prepared to enter his sanjeevan samadhi,
he carried a simple wooden stick —
a companion from his long walks.
Before descending into silence,
he pressed that staff into the earth.

From that gesture,
the elders say,
an Ajan tree rose.

Not planted as an orchard tree,
not cultivated for fruit,
but awakened from a saint’s final touch.
Its roots drank the memory of his presence,
and its branches spread like quiet understanding.

Because of that beginning,
my lineage is known as a tree of wisdom.
Some say my very name remembers ignorance —
the darkness that clouds the mind.
And they say I stand as its opposite:
a reminder that ignorance can be transformed
into seeing.

Under that original Ajan in Alandi,
devotees sat and read the Dnyaneshwari.
Pilgrims rested in its shade.
They believed the air there
still carried the saint’s breath.

I am a small continuation of that story.

When I was planted here at Morpeace,
I felt the echo of that ancient staff —
a quiet bridge stretching from Alandi
to this soil.
Though I am young,
I carry that lineage like a whisper in my sap.

My flowers will one day open white and fragrant.
My fruits will darken with ripeness.
My bark will thicken with years.
But even now, as a sapling,
I hold a simple teaching:

“Wisdom grows where remembrance is planted.”

Sacred places are not only inherited.
They can be created
through intention and care.

Sit near me if you wish.
Imagine that first Ajan rising
from a saint’s final gesture —
a living sign that endings
can become beginnings.

Here at Morpeace,
I grow as a quiet link to Alandi,
a young witness to an old story,
carrying the memory of a pilgrim’s staff
into a new forest.

And as my roots deepen,
I remind all who pause beside me:

Even a sapling
can carry centuries of light.
