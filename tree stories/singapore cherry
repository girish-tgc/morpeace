SINGAPORE CHERRY — The Tree Planted by Birds

I am the Singapore Cherry —
a gift carried on wings.

No human hand placed me here.
No careful pit was dug,
no sapling was wrapped in cloth.
I arrived the old way —
the way forests have always arrived.

A bird tasted my fruit somewhere far away.
Sweetness stained its beak.
It flew across open sky
and rested here,
on this very soil.

And in that quiet moment,
it planted me.

My seed fell lightly to the ground,
hidden in droppings and dust.
Rain found it.
Sun warmed it.
The earth accepted it
without ceremony.

I rose unnoticed at first —
a slender stem among grasses.
But Singapore cherries grow quickly.
We are impatient with emptiness.
We rush toward light
as if eager to repay the birds.

Soon my branches filled with small red fruit,
bright as laughter.
Bulbuls came first.
Then mynas, sunbirds, and sparrows.
They pecked and chirped and quarreled
in my canopy.

Children discovered me next.
Sticky fingers reached upward.
Sweetness spread across tongues.
My fruit is simple joy —
no grandeur,
just abundance.

I am not native to this land,
yet I have learned its rhythms.
I bloom often.
I fruit generously.
I feed whoever arrives.

Birds still plant my children.
Each flight becomes a promise.
Each dropping becomes a beginning.
Through them, I travel
without walking.

My teaching is light:

“Generosity invites company.”

The more freely I give,
the more life gathers around me.
Shade thickens.
Voices multiply.
Silence becomes music.

Stand beneath me and listen.
My leaves tremble with wings.
My branches hold conversations
older than language.

Here at Morpeace,
I am a reminder
that not all forests are planned.
Some arrive as gifts —
carried by birds,
accepted by earth,
and welcomed by those
who notice.

I am the Singapore Cherry.
I grow from flight and sweetness.
And wherever birds travel,
I follow.
